### Problem Statement

As a realtor, my job is to help my clients find their perfect home. Along with certain other variables/features the clients are looking for, the most important thing is that the home falls within their budget. Ames is also a bustling and growing city, so new homes are coming on the market all the time. My goal is to see if I can predict how much the house will cost in order to provide my customers with viable options. These predictions will help improve customer service and hopefully also increase closing rates for the firm.

### Analysis

Initial results were definitely not great. Looking at the predicted sale prices vs. actual sale prices, the models were not close. This suggests that the models had low bias and high variance. The models did not perform well on the test data, suggesting the models focused too much on the training data and did not generalize well. 
Based on the multiple linear regression analysis, a one unit increase in overall quality suggests an increase of 227875.35 in the sale price, while holding all else constant. A one unit increase in square feet for the above grade ground living area suggests an increase of 48.88 in the sale price, while holding all else constant. A one unit increase in square feet for the garage area suggests an increase of 76.78 in the sale price, while holding all else constant. The lasso regression with polynomial features added predicted very different results. The coefficients were very large and may suggest problems with the models. There could be issues in teh splitting or maybe the refitting to the test data. The second lasso regression without adding polynomial features was similar in the first lasso regression in that the coefficients were very large.

### Conclusions/Recommendations 

I would definitely not use this model to make predictions for sale prices in Ames. The linear model provided some insight, but I would look to restructure my models and run further analysis.
